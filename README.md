# cod4maps #

Developed between 2010-04-11 and 2014-11-08.

## What is this?
This respository contains all maps and their complete source codes developed by PetX (or he contributes somehow) and few maps from Col!ar.

## How do I install it?
1. Install fresh copy of game to a folder (GAMEDIR)
2. Install official COD4 Mod Tools package to GAMEDIR folder
3. Clone this repository to GAMEDIR folder (it will add a lot of new files and overwrite some existing one)

## How do I compile a map?
Follow standard way of compiling. Some steps was modified to make it easier. Compiled map should be in usermaps folder.

## How do I run a map?
For most of maps you do not need any specific mod. Create a folder "maps" inside of "Mods" folder. 
Start a server using "server-classic.bat" and type a name of the map to the console.
Then you can connect to this server with "connect-fullscreen.bat" or "connect-window.bat" (use "connect-window2.bat" for a second player, "connect-window3.bat" for a third, etc.)
For custom mods use "server-deathrun.bat" or "server-escape.bat" after you copy certain mod to "Mods" folder.

## Where do I download the maps without compiling?
Just download from the release section: [![GitHub releases]](https://github.com/PetX1996/cod4maps/releases)
It comes as a ZIP, separated to released and unreleased maps. 
Divided to "usermaps", which can be extracted to the GAMEDIR and run directly. And "screens", which contains screenshots, videos, etc. 

## Can I contribute?
You can fork this repository and do whatever you want. I am not gonna develop it further.
